# 90tanks

* Simple JavaFX application written to learn JavaFX.
* Funtionality is pretty much the same as a game I played 15 years ago.

* Started on Dec 20, 2:30 PM. Completed layout (undocumented) on 5:05PM.
* Continued around 9:00 PM. Completed gameArea with basic logic to move the tank on 10:45PM.
* Took another 80 minutes (11:00PM to 12:20PM) to refactor and document everything.
* Spent another 2 hours on the next day, from 10:45AM to 12:45AM. Completed shell-shooting logic and documentation.
* Around an hour in the evening to add collision detection.
* Around two more hours on Dec 22 to complete v1.

### Questions
* Arrow keys do not work well when buttons are added (focus is moved to button even though I throw `setFocusTraversal(false)` around).
